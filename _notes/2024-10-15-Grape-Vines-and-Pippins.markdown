Give them offspring in number like unto full ears of grain; so that, having enough of all things, they may abound in every work that is good and acceptable unto Thee. Let them see their childrenâ€™s children, like olive shoots around their table; so that, finding favor in Thy sight, they may shine like the stars of heaven, in Thee, our God.

This is a wedding gift for dear friends who married in June; I enjoyed working on it and I think it turned out well. After finishing stitching it took me an additional month and a half to muster up the wherewithal mentally and physically to frame the thing, but I got there eventually. And in all the months I've been working on this, I've only bled over it twice and got blood onto it only once! (thank goodness the blood stain is on the back hidden in the fold of the lacing lol)

If the title of the design is slightly mysterious, wonder no longer... a pippin is another name for an apple. The tawny light yellow shapes with the pink knots (cf. the 6th picture below) are small apples that have just set; the pink is the tassel of the flower's pistil and stamen that are still present on very young fruit. One of my favorite things about plant imagery happens when fruit and flowers can be brought together out-of-time. Apple fruits set in early spring; the pale fruit is small, hopeful, waiting. Grapes become full ripe clusters at the beginning of harvest season, around the beginning of August in the Northern hemisphere. And so: a fitting juxtaposition of anticipation with the very beginning of fulfillment shown by grape vines and pippins.

Friends, I prayed much for you while I stitched and I love you both dearly. Also, I'm sorry if it ever falls out of the frame; I don't think I did a very good job, but I hope I did a good enough job... The aim was for it to be secure without compromising the ability to take it apart again if needed. Aaaanyway.

God grant you many many years!!
### in summary:
* the third kit-design I've done from Melbury hill, pretty straight forward process of stitching
* the linen twill that came with the kit was dark compared to the reference photos, so I traced the design onto lighter colored linen twill I had in my stash
* yay <3
