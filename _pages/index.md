# Welcome!

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #eee6ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  This is my hypertext commonplace. [[Choose your own adventure]] as you read through my notes on making and mending and watching things grow.
</p>

This site is where I think out loud, inspired by my years of keeping physical commonplace books and by others making <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital gardens.</a> Entries here will more often than not be rough, short thoughts that link up with other little ideas, or quotes from what I'm reading, or notes on what I'm making.

<strong>Recently updated notes</strong>

<ul>
  {% assign recent_notes = site.notes | sort: "last_modified_at_timestamp" | reverse %}
  {% for note in recent_notes limit: 5 %}
    <li>
      {{ note.last_modified_at | date: "%m-%d-%Y" }} â€” <a class="internal-link" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ note.url }}">{{ note.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
